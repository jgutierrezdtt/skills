# SAST and DAST Fix Planning

This reference covers **Phase 2 (planning)** for Static (SAST) and Dynamic (DAST) Fortify findings. Work through all steps in order and complete the Phase 2 Completion Gate before returning to SKILL.md for Phase 3.

## Step 1: Retrieve Full Issue Details

Standard issue list output gives you category, severity, file, and line number — enough to identify issues but not enough to understand the root cause. Before you plan any fix, pull the embedded details.

Determine your retrieval scope first:
- **≤10 issues**: retrieve full details for all of them
- **>10 issues**: start with a representative sample of 3 issues; retrieve more incrementally until you've identified the pattern. The same root cause often recurs across many instances — understanding the pattern is more valuable than reading every instance.

### FoD — Embedding Details

```bash
# SAST issues — embed traces to see the dataflow path
# Note: FoD API returns HTTP 500 for multi-ID instanceId filters. Query one instanceId at a time.
fcli fod issue list --rel=<releaseNameOrId> \
  --query "instanceId=='<instanceId1>'" \
  --embed=summary,details,recommendations,traces -o json

# DAST issues — embed request/response to see the actual HTTP context
fcli fod issue list --rel=<releaseNameOrId> \
  --query "instanceId=='<instanceId1>'" \
  --embed=summary,recommendations,requestResponse -o json
```

> ⚠️ `--embed` makes a separate HTTP request per issue. Limit to no more than 3-5 issues at a time. Always filter to a specific set before embedding — never embed on a large unfiltered list.

### SSC — Embedding Details

```bash
fcli ssc issue list --av="<App:Version>" \
  --query "{'<instanceId1>','<instanceId2>'}.contains(issueInstanceId)" \
  --embed=details,comments -o json
```

SSC's embedded details include the issue abstract, description, recommendations, and in many cases the taint trace for SAST findings. The `comments` embed includes any comments added to the issue — importantly, Aviator AI analysis is posted here as comments by the 'Fortify Aviator' user, and is the primary source of Aviator guidance on SSC.

### SSC — DAST Issue HTTP Details

SSC's `--embed` for issue list does not include HTTP request/response data for DAST findings. To retrieve DAST attack details, use the SSC REST API's `issueDetails` endpoint:

```bash
# Retrieve full DAST issue details including HTTP request/response
# Use the numeric 'id' field from the issue list output
fcli ssc rest call -X GET /api/v1/issueDetails/<id>
```

The `issueDetails` response includes DAST-specific fields:
- `requestHeader`, `requestBody`, `requestParameter` — the HTTP request context
- `responseHeader`, `response` — the HTTP response
- `attackPayload` — the payload used to trigger the vulnerability
- `attackType` — where the payload was injected (`URL`, `REQUEST_HEADER`, `REQUEST_COOKIE`, `PARAMETER`, `MULTIPLE`)
- `vulnerableParameter` — the specific parameter exploited
- `method`, `url`, `cookie` — request metadata

Use `engineCategory == 'DYNAMIC'` in the issue details to confirm you're looking at a DAST finding.

## Step 2: Retrieve Aviator AI Guidance

Fortify Aviator is Fortify's AI-powered code review and remediation system. When it has analyzed an issue, it produces fix recommendations specifically tied to the vulnerable code — use this as your **primary input** for planning the fix, since it's already grounded in the specific code context.

Aviator guidance is available through different channels depending on the platform. In all cases, prioritize it over generic remediation advice.

### FoD — API Guidance (Preferred)

Each FoD issue record includes two fields that together determine what Aviator guidance is available:

- `fortifyAviator` (bool) — whether Aviator was run on this issue at all. If `false`, no Aviator guidance exists anywhere — skip to Step 3.
- `aviatorRemediationGuidanceAvailable` (bool) — whether Aviator has produced structured JSON fix recommendations accessible via the REST API.

**Decision logic:**

| `fortifyAviator` | `aviatorRemediationGuidanceAvailable` | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `false` | (any) | No Aviator guidance — proceed to Step 3 |
| `true` | `true` | Retrieve via REST API **and** check comments |
| `true` | `false` | Check comments only |

Both fields are present in the standard `fcli fod issue list -o json` output — include them when retrieving issue details at Step 1.

**When `aviatorRemediationGuidanceAvailable == true`**, retrieve the Aviator guidance via the FoD REST API:

```bash
# Get Aviator remediation guidance for a specific issue
# IMPORTANT: use the numeric 'id' field from the issue list output, NOT 'instanceId'.
# The issue list JSON contains both: 'instanceId' (string, used in --query filters)
# and 'id' (integer, used in REST API URL paths). Map between them by reading
# both fields from the same issue list record.
fcli fod rest call -X GET /api/v3/releases/<releaseId>/vulnerabilities/<id>/aviator-remediation-guidance
```

### FoD — Aviator Guidance via Comments

Whenever `fortifyAviator == true`, Aviator's analysis will also be present as a comment on the issue, posted by user `'Fortify Aviator'`. **Always check comments alongside the API response** — the comment may contain additional context, reasoning, or nuance not captured in the structured JSON guidance. Check the `comments` array in the `summary` embed (already included in the Step 1 SAST embed command):

```bash
# The summary embed includes a 'comments' array — filter for Aviator's entries
# Look for: comment objects where the username/author field is 'Fortify Aviator'
# Note: query one instanceId at a time for FoD (multi-ID filters cause HTTP 500)
fcli fod issue list --rel=<releaseNameOrId> \
  --query "instanceId=='<instanceId1>'" \
  --embed=summary -o json
```

> Note: Even when `fortifyAviator == false`, the issue may have comments from users (developers, security auditors, etc.). Always review the full comment thread — it may contain context about false positives or prior remediation attempts that informs your fix plan.

### SSC — Aviator Guidance via Comments

SSC does not have a dedicated REST endpoint for Aviator remediation guidance. Aviator posts its analysis directly as comments on the issue. Use the `comments` embed (already included in the Step 1 SSC embed command) and look for comments authored by `'Fortify Aviator'`:

```bash
# The comments embed returns the full comment thread — filter for Aviator's entries
# Look for: comment objects where the username/author field is 'Fortify Aviator'
fcli ssc issue list --av="<App:Version>" \
  --query "{'<instanceId1>','<instanceId2>'}.contains(issueInstanceId)" \
  --embed=comments -o json
```

Aviator guidance typically includes:
- Confirmation that the issue is a true positive (or flag if it disagrees)
- A suggested code fix with explanation
- Contextual notes about why the current code is vulnerable

Treat Aviator guidance as a strong signal but not infallible — review it against the actual code before applying.

## Step 3: Read and Interpret SAST Traces

A SAST trace shows the **dataflow path** from source (where untrusted data enters) to sink (where it is used unsafely). Reading the trace correctly is essential for identifying the right fix location.

**Key trace concepts:**

- **Source** — where untrusted data originates (user HTTP input, file read, environment variable, DB field marked as taint source, etc.)
- **Sink** — where the tainted data causes harm (SQL query, HTML output, OS command, file path, etc.)
- **Taint propagation** — intermediate steps that carry the data forward without sanitizing it
- **Fix location** — usually the first point where you can safely sanitize, validate, or neutralize the data before it reaches a dangerous junction. This is often *not* at the sink — fixing at the sink is a last resort.

**Reading strategy:**

1. Start at the source — what is the data, and how untrustworthy is it? (User input is highest risk; internal config is lower)
2. Follow the path — are there any existing sanitization steps that Fortify missed? If so, this may be a false positive worth reviewing with the user rather than changing code.
3. Find the earliest practical fix point — validation or encoding close to the source is usually more robust than guarding at the sink.
4. Check if sanitization already exists elsewhere in the codebase — reuse it.

**False positive awareness**: If the trace shows data passing through a sanitization or validation step that Fortify didn't recognize, or the source is not actually untrusted in context, flag this to the user as a potential false positive before planning a code change. Unaudited issues (FoD `auditorStatus == 'Pending Review'`; SSC with no `Analysis` tag) warrant extra scrutiny — verify the vulnerability is real before implementing a fix.

---

## Step 4: DAST-Specific Considerations

DAST findings are observed at runtime against a deployed application. Unlike SAST, you don't have a trace — you have a request, a response, and Fortify's classification of the vulnerability.

**For DAST findings:**

- Read the `requestResponse` embed carefully. The request shows the attack payload Fortify sent; the response shows what the application returned.
- The fix may be in code (e.g., output encoding for XSS), configuration (e.g., security headers), or infrastructure (e.g., TLS settings). Identify which layer is responsible before planning the change.
- DAST findings may be harder to correlate to exact code locations. Use the URL path to identify the relevant controller/handler, then trace the specific parameter through the code.
- Some DAST findings (e.g., missing security headers) are best addressed at the middleware or framework level once and will close all similar findings across the app.

---

## Step 5: Examine the Codebase

Read the relevant source files **from the local workspace the user is working in**. The source is almost always already checked out there. Do **not** offer to extract source from the FPR or download it from FoD/SSC — that path requires pulling and unpacking the FPR, only works in narrow cases, and is essentially never what the user wants when their working tree is open.

If a referenced file genuinely isn't present in the workspace, say so and ask the user where to find it. Do not silently fall back to FPR extraction.

Fortify scans are a snapshot. The code may have changed since the scan:

- **Never assume line numbers are current.** Use the file name, class name, function name, or the specific code pattern from the trace to locate the actual code.
- **Identify the root cause at the code level.** The Fortify description tells you the vulnerability class; the trace or code tells you exactly what's happening.
- **Check if the code already has a partial fix.** If someone already added input validation after the scan ran, the issue may no longer be exploitable. Flag this to the user — it may need a re-scan to confirm, or may still need the fix completed.
- **Search for existing fix patterns.** Look for places in the codebase where similar vulnerabilities were already handled correctly — use those as your model. Consistency with existing patterns reduces review friction.
- **Check for duplicate patterns.** If the trace points to a utility method, that method may be called from many places. Fixing it there fixes all callers — identify all call sites to understand the blast radius of the change.

---

## Step 6: Formulate the Fix

Apply these constraints to every planned change:

- **Minimal diff** — Fix the vulnerability with the smallest correct change. Avoid touching unrelated logic.
- **No refactoring** — Do not restructure, rename, or otherwise improve code beyond what the fix requires, even if you notice opportunities.
- **Match code style** — Use the same formatting, naming, and idioms as the surrounding code.
- **One fix, many instances** — If a single fix pattern (e.g., a centralized validation helper) resolves multiple similar issues, implement it once and apply it. Do not copy-paste the fix N times when a shared approach is cleaner.
- **Consider side effects** — Input validation, output encoding, and parameterized query changes can affect behavior. Note any cases where the fix may change the observable output of a function.

---

## Step 7: Unit Test Guidance

Propose unit tests when:

- The fix adds a new validation or sanitization function (write a test that covers valid inputs, boundary inputs, and the specific attack payload from the Fortify trace)
- The fix modifies a function whose current tests don't cover the security-relevant path
- The issue is in a security-critical code path (authentication, authorization, cryptography, data access)
- The existing test suite is sparse for the affected files

Unit test guidelines for security fixes:
- Name the test clearly after the behavior it validates, not after the Fortify issue (e.g., `testQueryParamIsParameterized()`, not `testFortifyIssue12345()`)
- The test should fail on the unfixed code and pass on the fixed code — verify this if possible
- Include a test for the "happy path" (valid input succeeds) alongside the "attack path" (malicious input is rejected)

## Phase 2 Completion Gate

Before presenting the plan in Phase 3, verify all of the following. If any are unchecked, complete them first:

- [ ] Full issue details retrieved (traces for SAST; request/response for DAST)
- [ ] Aviator guidance checked and retrieved if available
- [ ] SAST trace read fully: source, all taint propagation steps, and sink identified
- [ ] Fix location chosen — earliest practical point in the taint path, not just at the sink
- [ ] Relevant source files read from the local workspace (not assumed from issue line numbers)
- [ ] Existing sanitization or fix patterns in the codebase searched for and identified
- [ ] Any potential false positives (existing sanitization Fortify missed, unreachable source) flagged to the user
- [ ] Each proposed change is minimal — no unrelated refactoring included
- [ ] Side effects that may change observable behavior are noted
- [ ] Any issues being deferred are identified with a clear reason

Phase 2 is complete. Return to SKILL.md for Phase 3.
